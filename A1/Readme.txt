Programs that are not my code: ADA, OCAML, PROLOG
Source: http://rosettacode.org/wiki/FizzBuzz


All 5 programs run the Fizbuzz Game correctly, nothing crazy there. 

They game logic itself for the program is super simple, just using mod. Writing the logic in C# and Python was easy. My C# and Python code looks super close to the rosettacode and I didn't even look at them for help since I knew
how to program with those languages. All they are are a loop with if statements.

Now, for the next easiest it would have to be ADA. It uses lots of words like Being loop etc, that it is very easy to follow, even though I never seen it before. I will say that it seems like this was the longest to write though.

OCaml is really weird, but I understand the uses of it. In Rossetacode, they used a pattern matching example with it. I realized that you just make two condition seperated by a comma, and if they match, output a certain thing.
This kinda  reminded me of switch statements.

Prolog was the worst of all. I dislike the language. It took me the longest to try to grasp, but I ended up using the RossetaCode for it.


Any Speed difference?
	When I ran the code, I didn't see any speed difference, but that could be since it was only from 1 to 100.


My Comments:
	After seeing code from rossetacode I would like to say that I am grasping the concepts and terms in these new languages.
